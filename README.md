# PhD Thesis of Dr Javier Sánchez Utgés

This is the repository I used to version control my PhD Thesis, entitled **_"Computational methods for the characterisation and evaluation of protein-ligand binding sites"_**, throughout the writing period.

I did my PhD in the [Barton Group](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Professor Geoffrey J Barton](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/geoffrey-barton), in the Computational Biology Division of the [School of Life Sciences](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/life-sciences) at the [University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/). The Thesis can also be found on the [Discovery Portal](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/computational-methods-for-the-characterisation-and-evaluation-of-) of the University . However, due to the processing by the [Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/en-gb/products/pure) platform, internal references are not functioning in that version. Best to download and read the version found on this [repository](https://github.com/JavierSanchez-Utges/JSUtges-PHD-Thesis/blob/master/JSU_PHD_THESIS.pdf).

The Thesis was written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) using the [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) editing platform, after the recommendation of [Tanmayee Narendra](https://ntanmayee.github.io/). [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is also a great option, but it did not work for me as I had many figures of large size, which exceeded their size limits. Nevertheless, it might be the best option if this is not the case for yours, since it includes seamless integration with GitHub and other cool features! I used [BibLaTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) for reference formatting and [XeLaTex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/XeLaTeX) for compilation. Figure files are not included in this repository.

The Thesis is divided in six chapters: one chapter of introduction, four of results and a final chapter of conclusions. Each one of these has their on `.tex` file included in the main document [`.tex`](https://github.com/JavierSanchez-Utges/JSUtges-PHD-Thesis/blob/master/JSU_PHD_THESIS.tex). The result chapters decsribe the work resulting of my PhD research which can also be found published in the literature.

+ Chapter 2 corresponds to **_"Classification of likely functional class for ligand binding sites identified from fragment screening"_**, published in [_Communications Biology_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-05970-8).
+ Chapter 3 corresponds to **_"LIGYSIS-web: a resource for the analysis of protein-ligand binding sites"_**, published in [_Nucleic Acids Research_](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaf411).
+ Chapters 4 and 5 correspond to **_"Comparative evaluation of methods for the prediction of protein–ligand binding sites"_**, published in [_Journal of Cheminformatics_](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-024-00923-z).

I put considerable effort into the formatting of the Thesis, so it would be easy to read, by including internal hyperreferences to figures, tables, equations, as well as copious hyperlinks to relevant resources such as [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/), [PDBe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) or [PDBe-KB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/). I hope this helps other fellow students in their writing process. Best of luck!
