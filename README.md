# PhD Thesis of Dr Javier Sánchez Utgés

This is the repository I used to version control my PhD Thesis throughout the writing period. The Thesis is written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) using the [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) editing platform, after the recommendation of [Tanmayee Narendra](https://ntanmayee.github.io/). [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is also a great option, but it did not work for me as I had many figures of large size, which exceeded their size limits. However, it might be the best option is this is not the case for yours, since it includes seamless integration with GitHub and other cool features!

I did my PhD in the [Barton Group](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Professor Geoffrey J Barton](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/geoffrey-barton), in the Computational Biology Division of the [School of Life Sciences](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/life-sciences) at the [University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/). The Thesis can also be found on the [Discovery Portal](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/computational-methods-for-the-characterisation-and-evaluation-of-) of the University . However, due to the processing by the [Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/en-gb/products/pure) platform, internal references are mangled. Best to download and read the version found on this [repository](https://github.com/JavierSanchez-Utges/JSUtges-PHD-Thesis/blob/master/JSU_PHD_THESIS.pdf).

The Thesis is divided in six chapters: one chapter of introduction, four of results and a final chapter of conclusions. Each one of these has their on `.tex` file included in the main document [`.tex`](https://github.com/JavierSanchez-Utges/JSUtges-PHD-Thesis/blob/master/JSU_PHD_THESIS.tex). I put a lot of effort into formatting this Thesis, so it would be easy to read and understand, by including copious hyperlinks to relevant resources such as [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/), [PDBe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) or [PDBe-KB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/). I hope this helps other fellow students in their writing process. Best of luck!
