In this Chapter, I introduce the basic concepts and methodologies necessary to understand this Thesis.

\section{The purpose of life}

``Long, long ago there was a time when nothing but mere matter existed in this world. In the teeming ooze, forms of a certain \textit{something} appeared, disappeared, and appeared again and one of them eventually survived. We know it as \textit{life}. The reason that \textit{life} ultimately survived was because it was in its nature \textit{to multiply}. \textit{Life} took new forms in order to multiply, adapting to every kind of environment, and culminating in \textit{us} today. Greater numbers, greater diversity, greater abundance. This is why we say that the purpose of \textit{life} is \textit{to multiply}.'' \cite{ISAYAMA_2021}
